# Merge Sort Implementation

## Overview
This program implements the Merge Sort algorithm in Python and Kotlin. merge Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It iterates through the input list, removing one element at a time and then finding its correct position within the sorted sublist.

## Implementation Details
- **Python Version**: The Python implementation of Merge Sort is provided in the `MergeSort` function within the `Merge_sort.py` file. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a tuple containing the sorted list and the elapsed time for the sorting process.
- **Kotlin Version**: The Kotlin implementation of Merge Sort is provided in the `MergeSort` function within the `MergeSort.kt` file. Similarly, it takes a mutable list of integers as input and returns a pair containing the sorted list and the elapsed time.

## Testing
The program includes a test utility function, `testFunction`, that allows for testing the Merge Sort implementation with various input lists. This function compares the output of the Merge Sort function with the output of the built-in sorting function to ensure correctness.

## Running the Program
To run the program:
- Ensure you have Python and Kotlin installed on your system.
- Execute the `Merge_sort.py` file for the Python implementation or the `MergeSort.kt` file for the Kotlin implementation.
